# 🎃 Horror Game (Game Jam Prototype)

A short horror game developed in **8 days** for the **SCREAM ZONE Jam** and **GameDev.tv Jam**.

This is an early **prototype** built in **Unity (C#)**.  
The goal was to create a tense and atmospheric experience under time constraints — focusing on gameplay flow, stage sequence control, and immersive ambiance.
